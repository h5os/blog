What is markdown?
-----------------
Markdown is a _lightweight_ markup language with a easy and simple 
syntax, designed to be easy for a human to enter with a simple 
text editor, and easy to read in its raw form. Lightweight markup 
languages are used in applications where people might be expected 
to read the document source as well as the rendered output. For 
instance, a person downloading a software library might prefer to 
read the documentation in a text editor rather than a browser.

Another application is for entry in web-based publishing, such as 
weblogs and wikis, where the input interface is a simple text box.
The server software converts the input to a common document markup 
language like HTML or XHTML.
